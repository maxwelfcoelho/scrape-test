## To Run the server

- I am using node 18.10.0 to be more precise, but I think it work with older and newer versions.
- npm install to install the dependencies
- npm run start to run the project at port 4000

## To run the client
- I choose to not use a bundler or whatever.
- just open the index.html in any modern browser inside the client folder.
